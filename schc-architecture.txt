1.  Introduction

   The IETF LPWAN WG defined the necessary operations to enable IPv6
   over selected Low-Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) radio
   technologies. [rfc8376] presents an overview of those technologies.

   The Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) [rfc8724] technology is
   the core product of the IETF LPWAN working group and was the basis to
   form the SCHC Working Group. [rfc8724] defines a generic framework
   for header compression and fragmentation, based on a static context
   that is pre-installed on the SCHC endpoints.

   This document details the constitutive elements of a SCHC-based
   solution, and how the solution can be deployed.  It provides a
   general architecture for a SCHC deployment, positioning the required
   specifications, describing the possible deployment types, and
   indicating models whereby the rules can be distributed and installed
   to enable reliable and scalable operations.

2.  LPWAN Technologies and Profiles

   Because LPWAN technologies [rfc8376] have strict yet distinct
   constraints, e.g., in terms of maximum frame size, throughput, and/or
   directionality, a SCHC instance must be profiled to adapt to the
   specific necessities of the technology to which it is applied.

   Appendix D.  OCGBPSCHC ParametersOCOe of [rfc8724] lists the
   information that an LPWAN technology-specific document must provide
   to profile SCHC for that technology.

   As an example, [rfc9011] provides the SCHC profile for LoRaWAN
   networks.

3.  The Static Context Header Compression

   SCHC [rfc8724] specifies an extreme compression capability based on a
   state that must match on the compressor and decompressor side.  This
   state comprises a set of Compression/Decompression (C/D) rules.

   The SCHC Parser analyzes incoming packets and creates a list of
   fields that it matches against the compression rules.  The rule that
   matches best is used to compress the packet, and the rule identifier
   (RuleID) is transmitted together with the compression residue to the
   decompressor.  Based on the RuleID and the residue, the decompressor
   can rebuild the original packet and forward it in its uncompressed
   form over the Internet.

   [rfc8724] also provides a Fragmentation/Reassembly (F/R) capability
   to cope with the maximum and/or variable frame size of a Link, which
   is extremely constrained in the case of an LPWAN network.

   If a SCHC-compressed packet is too large to be sent in a single Link-
   Layer PDU, the SCHC fragmentation can be applied on the compressed
   packet.  The process of SCHC fragmentation is similar to that of
   compression; the fragmentation rules that are programmed for this
   Device are checked to find the most appropriate one, regarding the
   SCHC packet size, the link error rate, and the reliability level
   required by the application.

   The ruleID allows to determine if it is a compression or
   fragmentation rule.

4.  SCHC Applicability

4.1.  LPWAN Overview

4.2.  Compressing Serial Streams

   [rfc8724] was defined to compress IPv6 [rfc8200] and UDP; but SCHC
   really is a generic compression and fragmentation technology.  As
   such, SCHC is agnostic to which protocol it compresses and at which
   layer it is operated.  The C/D peers may be hosted by different
   entities for different layers, and the F/R operation may also be
   performed between different parties, or different sub-layers in the
   same stack, and/or managed by different organizations.

   If a protocol or a layer requires additional capabilities, it is
   always possible to document more specifically how to use SCHC in that
   context, or to specify additional behaviours.  For instance,
   [rfc8824] extends the compression to CoAP [RFC7252] and OSCORE
   [RFC8613].

5.1.  SCHC Endpoints

   Section 3 of [rfc8724] depicts a typical network architecture for an
   LPWAN network, simplified from that shown in [rfc8376] and reproduced
   in Figure 1.

                Figure 1: Typical LPWAN Network Architecture

Internet-Draft             LPWAN Architecture                 March 2023


   Typically, an LPWAN network topology is star-oriented, which means
   that all packets between the same source-destination pair follow the
   same path from/to a central point.  In that model, highly constrained
   Devices (Dev) exchange information with LPWAN Application Servers
   (App) through a central Network Gateway (NGW), which can be powered
   and is typically a lot less constrained than the Devices.  Because
   Devices embed built-in applications, the traffic flows to be
   compressed are known in advance and the location of the C/D and F/R
   functions (e.g., at the Dev and NGW), and the associated rules, can
   be pre provisioned in the system before use.

   The SCHC operation requires a shared sense of which SCHC Device is
   Uplink (Dev to App) and which is Downlink (App to Dev), see
   [rfc8376].  In a star deployment, the hub is always considered Uplink
   and the spokes are Downlink.  The expectation is that the hub and
   spoke derive knowledge of their role from the network configuration
   and SCHC does not need to signal which is hub thus Uplink vs. which
   is spoke thus Downlink.  In other words, the link direction is
   determined from extrinsic properties, and is not advertised in the
   protocol.

   Nevertheless, SCHC is very generic and its applicability is not
   limited to star-oriented deployments and/or to use cases where
   applications are very static and the state provisioned in advance.
   In particular, a peer-to-peer (P2P) SCHC Instance (see Section 5.2)
   may be set up between peers of equivalent capabilities, and the link
   direction cannot be inferred, either from the network topology nor
   from the device capability.

   In that case, by convention, the device that initiates the connection
   that sustains the SCHC Instance is considered as being Downlink, IOW
   it plays the role of the Dev in [rfc8724].

   This convention can be reversed, e.g., by configuration, but for
   proper SCHC operation, it is required that the method used ensures
   that both ends are aware of their role, and then again this
   determination is based on extrinsic properties.

5.2.  SCHC Instances

   [rfc8724] defines a protocol operation between a pair of peers.  A
   session called a SCHC Instance is established and SCHC maintains a
   state and timers associated to that Instance.

   When the SCHC Device is a highly constrained unit, there is typically
   only one Instance for that Device, and all the traffic from and to
   the device is exchanged with the same Network Gateway.  All the
   traffic can thus be implicitly associated with the single Instance



Pelov, et al.           Expires 30 September 2023               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             LPWAN Architecture                 March 2023


   that the device supports, and the Device does not need to manipulate
   the concept.  For that reason, SCHC avoids to signal explicitly the
   Instance identification in its data packets.

   The Network Gateway, on the other hand, maintains multiple Instances,
   one per SCHC Device.  The Instance is derived from the lower layer,
   typically the source of an incoming SCHC packet.  The Instance is
   used in particular to select from the rule database the set of rules
   that apply to the SCHC Device, and the current state of their
   exchange, e.g., timers and previous fragments.

   This architecture generalizes the model to any kind of peers.  In the
   case of more capable devices, a SCHC Device may maintain more than
   one Instance with the same peer, or a set of different peers.  Since
   SCHC does not signal the Instance in its packets, the information
   must be derived from a lower layer point to point information.  For
   instance, the SCHC session can be associated one-to-one with a
   tunnel, a TLS session, or a TCP or a PPP connection.

   For instance, [I-D.thubert-schc-over-ppp] describes a type of
   deployment where the C/D and/or F/R operations are performed between
   peers of equal capabilities over a PPP [rfc2516] connection.  SCHC
   over PPP illustrates that with SCHC, the protocols that are
   compressed can be discovered dynamically and the rules can be fetched
   on-demand by both parties from the same Uniform Resource Name (URN)
   [rfc8141], ensuring that the peers use the exact same set of rules.

       |    IP    |  Ethernet  |    IP    |            ..          )
       |   Host   +-----/------+  Router  +----------(   Internet   )
       | SCHC C/D |  Serial    | SCHC C/D |            (         )
       +----------+            +----------+               ...
                   <-- SCHC -->
                     over PPP

                    Figure 2: PPP-based SCHC Deployment

   In that case, the SCHC Instance is derived from the PPP connection.
   This means that there can be only one Instance per PPP connection,
   and that all the flow and only the flow of that Instance is exchanged
   within the PPP connection.  As discussed in Section 5.1, the Uplink
   direction is from the node that initiated the PPP connection to the
   node that accepted it.

5.3.  Layering with SCHC Instances

   [rfc8724] states that a SCHC instance needs the rules to process C/D
   and F/R before the session starts, and that rules cannot be modified
   during the session.

   As represented figure Figure 3, the compression of the IP and UDP
   headers may be operated by a network SCHC instance whereas the end-
   to-end compression of the application payload happens between the
   Device and the application.  The compression of the application
   payload may be split in two instances to deal with the encrypted
   portion of the application PDU.  Fragmentation applies before LPWAN
   transportation layer.

   This document defines a generic architecture for SCHC that can be
   used at any of these levels.  The goal of the architectural document
   is to orchestrate the different protocols and data model defined by
   the LPWAN working group to design an operational and interoperable
   framework for allowing IP application over contrained networks.

6.  SCHC Data Model

   A SCHC instance, summarized in the Figure 4, implies C/D and/or F/R
   present in both end and that both ends are provisioned with the same
   set of rules.

          (-------)                                (-------)
          ( Rules )                                ( Rules )

          +-------+

                     Figure 4: Summarized SCHC elements

   A common rule representation that expresses the SCHC rules in an
   interoperable fashion is needed yo be able to provision end-points
   from different vendors To that effect, [rfc9363] defines a rule
   representation using the YANG [rfc7950] formalism.

   [rfc9363] defines an YANG data model to represent the rules.  This
   enables the use of several protocols for rule management, such as
   NETCONF[RFC6241], RESTCONF[RFC8040], and
   CORECONF[I-D.ietf-core-comi].  NETCONF uses SSH, RESTCONF uses HTTPS,
   and CORECONF uses CoAP(s) as their respective transport layer
   protocols.  The data is represented in XML under NETCONF, in
   JSON[RFC8259] under RESTCONF and in CBOR[RFC8949] under CORECONF.

                     Figure 5: Summerized SCHC elements

   The Rule Manager (RM) is in charge of handling data derived from the
   YANG Data Model and apply changes to the rules database Figure 5.

   The RM is an Application using the Internet to exchange information,
   therefore:

   *  for the network-level SCHC, the communication does not require
      routing.  Each of the end-points having an RM and both RMs can be
      viewed on the same link, therefore wellknown Link Local addresses
      can be used to identify the Device and the core RM.  L2 security
      MAY be deemed as sufficient, if it provides the necessary level of
      protection.

   *  for application-level SCHC, routing is involved and global IP
      addresses SHOULD be used.  End-to-end encryption is RECOMMENDED.

   Management messages can also be carried in the negotiation protocol
   as proposed in [I-D.thubert-schc-over-ppp].  The RM traffic may be
   itself compressed by SCHC: if CORECONF protocol is used, [rfc8824]

   In the context of LPWANs, the expectation is that SCHC rules are
   associated with a physical device that is deployed in a network.
   This section describes the actions taken to enable an automatic
   commissioning of the device in the network.

7.1.  Device Development

   The expectation for the development cycle is that message formats are
   documented as a data model that is used to generate rules.  Several
   models are possible:

   1.  In the application model, an interface definition language and
       binary communication protocol such as Apache Thrift is used, and
       the serialization code includes the SCHC operation.  This model
       imposes that both ends are compiled with the generated structures
       and linked with generated code that represents the rule
       operation.

   2.  In the device model, the rules are generated separately.  Only
       the device-side code is linked with generated code.  The Rules
       are published separately to be used by a generic SCHC engine that
       operates in a middle box such as a SCHC gateway.

   3.  In the protocol model, both endpoint generate a packet format
       that is imposed by a protocol.  In that case, the protocol itself
       is the source to generate the Rules.  Both ends of the SCHC
       compression are operated in middle boxes, and special attention
       must be taken to ensure that they operate on the compatible Rule
       sets, basically the same major version of the same Rule Set.

   Depending on the deployment, the tools thar generate the Rules should
   provide knobs to optimize the Rule set, e.g., more rules vs. larger
   residue.

7.2.  Rules Publication

   In the device model and in the protocol model, at least one of the
   endpoints must obtain the rule set dynamically.  The expectation is
   that the Rule Sets are published to a reachable repository and
   versionned (minor, major).  Each rule set should have its own Uniform
   Resource Names (URN) [RFC8141] and a version.

   The Rule Set should be authenticated to ensure that it is genuine, or
   obtained from a trusted app store.  A corrupted Rule Set may be used
   for multiple forms of attacks, more in Section 8.

7.3.  SCHC Device Deployment

   The device and the network should mutually authenticate themselves.
   The autonomic approach [RFC8993] provides a model to achieve this at
   scale with zero touch, in networks where enough bandwidth and compute
   are available.  In highly constrained networks, one touch is usually
   necessary to program keys in the devices.

   The initial handshake between the SCHC endpoints should comprise a
   capability exchange whereby URN and the version of the rule set are
   obtained or compared.  SCHC may not be used if both ends can not
   agree on an URN and a major version.  Manufacturer Usage Descriptions
   (MUD) [RFC8520] may be used for that purpose in the device model.

   Upon the handshake, both ends can agree on a rule set, their role
   when the rules are asymmetrical, and fetch the rule set if necessary.
   Optionally, a node that fetwhed a rule set may inform the other end
   that it is reacy from transmission.

7.4.  SCHC Device Maintenance

   URN update without device update (bug fix) FUOTA => new URN =>
   reprovisioning

7.5.  SCHC Device Decommissionning

   Signal from device/vendor/network admin

8.  Security Considerations

   SCHC is sensitive to the rules that could be abused to form arbitrary
   long messages or as a form of attack against the C/D and/or F/R
   functions, say to generate a buffer overflow and either modify the
   Device or crash it.  It is thus critical to ensure that the rules are
   distributed in a fashion that is protected against tempering, e.g.,
   encrypted and signed.
